# Road Fatalities in Victoria

This is a piece work from COMP20008 Elements of Data Processing Project 1(University of Melborune).

I finished this work in 09/2019.

In this project, I explore the patterns surrounding motorists speeding in Melbourne so that I can suggest targeted interventions. To that end, Iâ€™m pointed to the Traffic Count Vehicle Classification dataset from the City of Melbourne. The dataset contains survey results showing the number of vehicles of different types that have traversed particular road segments at a particular time. It also includes the speed limit of the roads and data related to the speeds of vehicles traveling on the roads. For this project, I apply various wrangling skills including processing and effective visualization techniques to make sense of the data.

1.c is the code file, others are test cases.
